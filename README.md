# PyCitySchools - Education Data Analysis
**Overview**

This project simulates district-wide standaridzed test performance through a simulated education analytics scenario. Acting in the role of a data aalyst for a city district, the object is to evaluate student match and reading outcomes, identify performance trends, and generate insights that could inform strategic planning and resource allocations.

Using **Pandas** and **Jupyter Notebook**, this analysis aggregated student- and school-level data to produce district sumamries, school comparisons, and performanc breakdowns across multiple dimensions.

## dataset
The Dataset incldues:
* 15 schools
* 39,170 students
* Student-level math scores
* Student-level reading scores
* Grade level information (9th-12th)
* School-level information (e.g., school name, type, size, budget, etc.)

## Key Findings
* Reading outperformed math district-wide, with an average reading score of 81.88 (85.81% passing) comapred to an average math score of 78.99 (74.99%).
* Charter schools consistenly outperformed district schools, achieveing overall passing rates as high as 90.37% despite lower per-student spending.
* Higher spending did not correlate with stronger peformance, as lower spending ranges outperformed higher spending ranges in overall passing rates.
* School size showed a negative correlation with outcomes -- small and medium schools significantly outperformed large schools (2000-5000 students).
